# Customer-Segmentation_End-to-end-Project :man_scientist: :hugs: :computer:




## About this project

The objective of this project is to segment customers using a clustering prediction algorithm, in addition we **answer some businesses questions** that are grounded on the jupyter notebook. Also, this is a complete project as we go through several steps of a usual data science project such as data collection, feature engineering, data cleansing, data transformation, data visualization, data analysis, modeling and **cloud deployment**.

## Applications 

The current project can be used to help companies and retailers find out which customers buy, what they buy, how they spend and the like. Through this project, companies can create advertisements or discounts for specific customers. Although this program is part of my personal portfolio, please feel free to use it for studies, repairs and improvements. :call_me_hand:

## Motivation
This project was developed to be part of my personal portfolio and served both to test my skills and for my learning, since countless technologies could be used in it. Despite being an end-to-end project, it still needs some future improvements, such as having a larger and more diverse dataset. :smiley:
